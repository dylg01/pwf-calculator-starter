# PAC Western Calculator — Starter

This is a **ready-to-deploy** GitHub Pages structure. Drop your existing code in and publish.

## Where to paste things
- **index.html** — main calculator page. Replace the placeholder `<div id="calculator-root">` with your actual HTML for the main calculator.
- **quick-quote.html** — optional Quick Quote page. Replace the placeholder `<div id="quick-quote-root">` with your Quick Quote UI, or delete this file if your app is single-page.
- **css/styles.css** — put your CSS here (or replace this file with your own).
- **js/app.js** — put your JavaScript here (or split into multiple files).
- **js/payment-schedule.js** — optional stub for your Payment Schedule button logic. Remove if not needed.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1) Open `index.html` locally to confirm it loads.
2) Use GitHub Desktop: Add/commit/publish the repo.
3) On GitHub → Settings → Pages:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / **root**
4) Open the URL GitHub provides.

## Notes
- Keep paths **relative**: `./css/styles.css`, `./js/app.js`, `./assets/...`
- Filenames on the web are case-sensitive.
- If you use folders beginning with `_`, leave the `.nojekyll` file in place.
